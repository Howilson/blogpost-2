### Blog Post 2

=============

In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps to set up a Sveltekit app, from installing the necessary dependencies to set up your app.

Step 1: Install Node.js

 Before you can start using Sveltekit, you'll need to install Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).

 Step 2: Initialize your Project

 Once Node.js is installed, you can install Sveltekit. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:.

 ```
 
        npm create svelte@latest projectName
    
```

 This command will create a new Sveltekit app.

Step 3: Set up your Dev Server

 You can begin setting up your server using the following code

```

cd yourprojectname
npm install
code . 
npm run dev -- --open

```

 Now you should be able to see your page in your chosen browser.

 You can now change the homepage content of your SvelteKit app by entering into the src/routes/+page.svelte and entering your own text in the HTML tags.

 If you wish to expand upon your sveltekit app you can do so by adding CSS styles, global style sheets, multiple pages using routes, and more.
